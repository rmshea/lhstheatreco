# Technical Crews

## Welcome to the technical side of our company.

We have a world-class team of designers, builders, and technicians that help build the world for our shows. 

After cast lists are posted for the semester, crew signups will be added to the Call Board outside room E130. Sign up for the crew that you are interested in, and attend the following theatre company meeting. Crew chiefs will split up and give more information depending on the specific crew.
