# Parents

## Get Involved

It is only with the assistance of parents that we can run a successful program.  There are various ways parents can get involved, or help support us financially.

### Boosters

The booster parents are the backbone of our productions. Each production has specific and individual needs based on the show. If you'd like to become a booster, [click on this ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1955pvZt4GUIuVG-HP3tpOr3PfFGIdfiKL1wsNENhIoM/edit?usp=sharing)to fill out a form and scan it and email it to [jsmykil@jeffco.k12.co.us](mailto:jsmykil@jeffco.k12.co.us) or have your student bring it to the LHS Drama Room. Thank you for sharing your time and talents!

### Patrons

Becoming a theatre patron shows the LHS community just how much you support the LHS Theatre Company and its self sustaining programs. There are four levels of patrons, each guaranteeing you a listing in all of the Main Stage programs under the appropriate level of your gift. As an Orchestra Gold member, you also get an engraved plaque that will be placed on a seat in the LHS Theatre to be enjoyed by patrons for years to come. It's a special gift you can give to your student to commemorate their time with the LHS Theatre Company. If you'd like to become a Patron of the LHS Theatre Company, please click [**here**](patrons.md) ****to find out the levels of giving. And thank you for your contribution!

## Booster Parent Roles

### Food Parents

Parents provide food for cast and crew the week of the shows. Food parents volunteer to bring enough food to provide for the number of involved students \(often times, parents team up\).

### Tickets

Parents sit at the box office and sell tickets/run will call the evening of the performances.

### Costumes

Parents assist with the organization of costumes for a specific show. Seamstress skills are welcome! Parents work with students during the rehearsal process to complete the costume plot.

### Props

Parents assist in the location of difficult props.
