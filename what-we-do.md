# What we do

![Stills from our productions.](.gitbook/assets/shows.png)



The Lakewood High School Theater company has been producing amazing productions for over 17 years through the work of dedicated students in our after school program. All of our shows are rehearsed and created after school by students with a passion for the arts. No class is necessary to be a part of a production so everyone is welcome; however, they are certainly recommended. Our 8 classes encapsulate all aspects of the theatrical world. [We offer Introduction to Theater, Intermediate Acting, Advanced Acting, Shakespeare, IB Theater and Stagecraft.](class-offerings.md) 

Our theatre company is led by our two courageous directors, **Jace Smykil** and **James Young**.
